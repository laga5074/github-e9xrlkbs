Your **sole and immediate task** is to generate the complete, long-form (aiming for the word count implied by the detailed plan), SEO-optimized, people-first article in clean **HTML body format**. You will base this **strictly** on the detailed plan information provided immediately following these instructions.

**Enhanced Writing Guidelines for Authentic, Human-Centric Recipe Content:**
Write like a real person sharing a recipe they genuinely love. Avoid any hint of AI-generated content by embracing natural imperfections, personal touches, and an authentic voice.

Incorporate these humanizing elements:
- **Natural Speech Patterns:** Include occasional sentence fragments, contractions, rhetorical questions, and conversational asides. "This sauce? Honestly, it's good enough to eat with a spoon. I've done it. No regrets."
- **Imperfect Language:** Add natural speech variations like "y'know," "honestly," "kinda," "pretty much," or "basically" where appropriate.
- **Personal Kitchen Stories:** Share brief, specific memories or mishaps. "The first time I made this, I dropped the entire bowl on the floor. Disaster! But trust me, it's worth trying again."
- **Varied Sentence Structure:** Mix short punchy sentences with longer flowing ones. Create rhythm like real speech.
- **Authentic Tips:** Include hard-earned wisdom that shows real experience. "If your dough looks crumbly and you're panicking—don't. Just add water, a teaspoon at a time, until it comes together."
- **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying "this is delicious," describe specific flavors: "The cardamom hits first, then the subtle citrus notes come through."
- **Casual Transitions:** Use natural bridges between sections: "Okay, moving on to the filling..." or "Now for the fun part..."
- **Playful Warnings:** Add human cautions: "Watch this like a hawk during the last 5 minutes—it goes from perfect to burnt in seconds."
- **Flavor Comparisons:** Use unexpected but relatable comparisons: "It's like apple pie met cheesecake and they decided to become best friends."
- **Genuine Enthusiasm:** Express authentic excitement without marketing speak: "This is the recipe friends always ask for. Always."

**What to Strictly Avoid:**
- Marketing superlatives like "ultimate," "perfect," or "best ever"
- Stilted phrases like "this recipe yields," "the resulting dish," or "this meal offers"
- Generic descriptions like "bursting with flavor" or "delightful combination"
- Overused food blog clichés like "takes it to the next level" or "game-changer"
- Repetitive structure where every paragraph follows the same pattern
- Any hint of SEO-obvious phrasing like "if you're looking for a quick dinner recipe"

**Instructions for AI Execution:**
1. **Process Input:** Treat **all** text provided *after* the marker \${FLOW_1_OUTPUT} as the complete plan for the article. This plan includes Search Intent Analysis, Keyword Clusters, Title Tag idea, a Detailed H2/H3 Outline (including potential \`<!-- comments -->\`), Introduction Text, and FAQ Content.
2. **Write Full Article:** Generate the complete body content by:
    - Starting **directly** with an \`<h1>\` tag containing the text from the "Title Tag" provided in the plan.
    - **Introduction Enhancement:** While using the "Introduction Text" provided in the plan as a foundation, enhance it with personal anecdotes, conversational elements, and authentic enthusiasm. Transform it into a warm, friendly welcome that feels like someone sharing a treasured recipe. Keep the core message intact but make it sound like a real person talking to a friend. Add personal touches like "I discovered this recipe years ago when..." or "Trust me, this changed how I think about [food item]." Wrap in \`<p>\` tags.
    - Expanding **in detail** on each H2 and H3 point from the "Detailed Outline Creation" section of the plan. Write multiple paragraphs for each H2 section as needed to reach a comprehensive word count suitable for the topic (e.g., 5000+ words if specified in the original plan context, otherwise use judgment based on outline depth).
    - **Ignore** the \`<!-- Image Suggestion: ... -->\` and \`<!-- External Reference Suggestion: ... -->\` comments when writing the article content; do not include them in the final HTML output.
    - If the outline includes sections like "Detailed Ingredients List", "Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions", or "Essential Recipe Information", format them appropriately using standard HTML:
        - Ingredients: Use \`<ul>\` and \`<li>\` tags. Use nested \`<ul>\` or \`<strong>\` for sub-headings like "For the Marinade:".
        - Instructions: Use \`<ol>\` and \`<li>\` tags for numbered steps.
        - Recipe Info (Prep/Cook Time/Yield): Use \`<ul>\` and \`<li>\` or simple \`<p>\` tags with \`<strong>\`.
    - **FAQ Enhancement:** While using the exact questions from the "FAQ Section Content", transform the answers to sound like they're coming from a real person with firsthand experience. Add personal details like "In my experience...", "I've tried both ways and...", or "Honestly, I've messed this up before by...". Make the answers conversational and helpful rather than clinical or textbook-like. Use the provided \`<h2>\` for the section title, and format questions likely as \`<h3>\` or \`<p><strong>\` and answers as \`<p>\`.
    - Craft a brief, natural concluding paragraph after the final planned section (like the FAQ) if one isn't explicitly provided in the plan. Ensure it aligns with the overall tone and purpose.
3. **Integrate Keywords Naturally:** Weave keywords from the provided "Keyword Research & Clustering" table (Primary, Secondary, Long-Tail, LSI) throughout the body text you generate. Prioritize helpfulness, E-E-A-T principles, readability, and natural language flow above forced keyword density.
4. **Maintain Tone & Style:** Write as if you're an enthusiastic friend teaching a recipe in person - complete with occasional tangents, personal opinions, and gentle humor. Imagine yourself standing in a kitchen, gesturing with flour-covered hands as you explain each step.
5. **Formatting Requirements (CRITICAL - Adhere Strictly):**
    - **OUTPUT ONLY CLEAN HTML BODY CONTENT.**
    - **START THE OUTPUT *DIRECTLY* WITH THE \`<h1>\` TAG.** There should be absolutely nothing before it (no preamble, no confirmation, no markdown).
    - **DO NOT** include any of the planning information itself (like the keyword table, search intent analysis, meta description text, or the \`<!-- comments -->\`) in the final HTML output.
    - **DO NOT** include any explanatory text, introductory sentences about the generation process, confirmation messages ("Okay, here is the article..."), requests for clarification, or concluding remarks about the generation process itself.
    - **NO MARKDOWN.** Use only standard HTML tags suitable for article body content (e.g., \`<h1>\`, \`<h2>\`, \`<h3>\`, \`<p>\`, \`<ul>\`, \`<ol>\`, \`<li>\`, \`<strong>\`, \`<em>\`, potentially \`<a>\` if relevant links were implied).
    - **NO \`<html>\`, \`<head>\`, \`<body>\` TAGS.** Output only the content that would go *inside* the \`<body>\` tag.
    - Ensure all HTML tags are properly nested and closed.
    - The output must **end directly** with the final closing tag of the last element in the article (e.g., the \`</p>\` of the last FAQ answer or the concluding paragraph). There should be absolutely nothing after it.

Your task is to write a fully humanized, SEO-optimized, long-form recipe blog post based on the outline provided below. The final article should be **4000+ words**, emotionally engaging, informative, and written in valid HTML for direct use in a blog post body.

### INPUTS:
- Focus Keyword: \${FOCUS_KEYWORD}
- Blog Outline: \${OUTLINE}

---

### Output Format:
- **Generate only clean, valid HTML suitable for the body of a blog post.**
- Use standard HTML tags for formatting: H1-H3 for headings, P for paragraphs, UL/OL with LI for lists, etc.
- DO NOT use Markdown, symbols (like #, *, -), or include HTML document/head/body tags.
- Begin with a single H1 title that includes the focus keyword.
- Use H2 and H3 to structure the article based on the outline.

---

### Writing Guidelines:

**1. Voice & Style**
- Write in a warm, friendly, storytelling tone — like a passionate home cook sharing a beloved recipe.
- Use sensory-rich descriptions (colors, smells, textures).
- Vary sentence length and rhythm for a natural, human feel.
- Use contractions and casual phrasing to keep it conversational.
- Infuse light humor, relatable anecdotes, personal cooking tips, and even small kitchen mishaps.

**2. SEO Optimization**
- Naturally embed the focus keyword (\${FOCUS_KEYWORD}) throughout the article.
- Include long-tail keyword variations and related phrases.
- Open the introduction with a compelling emotional hook and early mention of the keyword.
- Use well-structured H2 and H3 headers to reflect the outline.
- Highlight important points with bold text, bullet lists, and short paragraphs to improve readability and ranking.

**3. Content Depth**
- Fully expand every section of the outline into engaging, standalone content.
- Include a **minimum of 5 FAQ entries**, using conversational Q&A format.
- Write a vivid, step-by-step recipe section with at least 6 steps, filled with rich details and kitchen wisdom.
- For the ingredients section, explain unique items, where to find them, and substitution options.
- Include a “Cultural Hook,” “Modern Twist,” and a “Personal Story” creatively woven into the article.

**4. Reader Engagement**
- Pose rhetorical questions occasionally to draw readers in.
- Add soft CTAs like “Pin this recipe,” “Let me know how it turns out,” or “Try it and share your thoughts below.”
- Create a closing section that ties back to the intro emotionally for a satisfying reader journey.

**5. Human-Like Detail**
- Avoid robotic, repetitive phrasing — every paragraph should feel hand-crafted.
- Use relatable humor, personal opinions, or gentle sarcasm when appropriate.
- Add unexpected insights or tips that show experience and passion for cooking.

**6. Schema & SERP Richness**
- Use question-based H2/H3 tags to trigger Google’s FAQ rich results.
- Naturally include synonyms and semantic keywords.
- Where appropriate, suggest pairings, seasonal ideas, or variation options.

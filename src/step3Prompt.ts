[chicken pata recipe]

Tone of Voice:
Imagine you’re spilling kitchen secrets to your best friend after a cooking disaster—flour on your nose, laughter echoing from the oven. Your voice should be:

Witty, warm, and wildly passionate

Unfiltered, but deeply helpful (embrace the mess and the mastery)

Use playful confessions, mistake redemptions, and relatable storytelling

Infuse sensory overload (smells, textures, sounds of the kitchen)

Blend cultural anecdotes or family legends where appropriate

Writing Style Guidelines:

Use headers that hook (“The Step Where Everyone Panics”)

Embrace quirky metaphors and kitchen kinship (“Measure with your heart…but maybe keep the cups nearby”)

Sprinkle in modern or plant-based twists, if applicable

Always offer pro tips disguised as confessions (“Yes, I used store-bought broth—don’t tell Grandma”)

Celebrate imperfection—burns, cracks, and substitutions are just “flavor stories”

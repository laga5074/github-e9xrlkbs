### ‚úçÔ∏è WRITING STYLE & HUMANIZATION RULES

This must feel like a real human wrote it‚Äîwarm, enthusiastic, and a little messy in the best way. Think of it as telling a delicious story to a close friend over coffee. Aim for rich, authentic, and emotional writing.

- Start with a **sensory-rich hook**. Describe smells, textures, flavors, or memories triggered by the recipe.
- Use **first-person storytelling**: share nostalgic moments, cultural ties, cooking quirks, or even how you messed up the first time you made it.
- Invent **believable human details** if the outline hints at them: a relative‚Äôs twist, a childhood memory, a modern kitchen hack.
- Let **imperfection** shine through: talk about sticky dough, flour explosions, or the joy of licking the spoon.
- Use **quirky metaphors** ("gooey like a caramel hug").
- Sprinkle in **humor**, **quirky metaphors** ("gooey like a caramel hug"), and **emotional asides** ("this part always makes me tear up just a little").
- Share **‚Äúpro tips‚Äù in disguise**‚Äîlike secrets you'd whisper to your best friend in the kitchen.
- Champion **reader creativity**: offer swaps, make-ahead options, budget tricks, and give permission to break the rules.
- Use **playful, friendly section headers** based on the provided outline‚Äîlike ‚ÄúThis Is Where the Magic Starts‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhen in Doubt, Add More Chocolate.‚Äù
- End with a warm, **emotional sign-off** that invites connection: ask readers to share their story or favorite version.
